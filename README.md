# Dotfiles

All my dotfiles in on place for easy installing

## Installation
Note: This deletes existing symlinks or dotfiles in `~/`, so use with care
```
# create dotfile symlinks inside your home dir
./create_symlinks.sh
# if you want the minimal vimrc instead of the big one....
./create_minimal_vimrc_symlinks.sh
```

Thanks to dimroc, pivotal & mutewinter for the original vim configs which mine are based on.
